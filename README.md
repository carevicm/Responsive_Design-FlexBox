README for Flexbox Pricing Table

Introduction

Hello there! Welcome to my Flexbox Pricing Table. I've crafted this beautiful pricing table using flexbox, ensuring it's both responsive and elegant. 
With a focus on simplicity and readability, I've designed this table to help businesses showcase their various subscription plans in style.

Features

Responsive Design: My pricing table is fully responsive, adjusting itself for both desktop and mobile views.

Clean UI: With a minimalist approach, I've ensured that users can quickly grasp the different plans and their features.

Custom Font: I've integrated the 'Sono' font from Google Fonts, giving the table a distinct and modern look.

Three Pricing Plans: I've provided three different pricing plans – Basic, Standard, and Premium – that can easily be customized to fit your needs.

Interactive Sign-Up Button: Each pricing plan comes with a vibrant sign-up button that's just waiting to be linked to your subscription or sign-up page!
